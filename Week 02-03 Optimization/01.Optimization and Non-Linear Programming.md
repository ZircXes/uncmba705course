# Optimization with Linear and Non-Linear Programming in Python

### Major libraries (open-Source) in Python
* Gekko
* SciPy

For this course, I've chosen Gekko as the implementation is significantly more intuitive and the APOPT solver appears to be a highly recommended open-source solver. While commercial solvers are still superior, we want to get the best solver possible for our purposes.
